# book-recommendations

Using Ruby, I programmed a book recommender. With a provided dataset of books, their respective authors, and ratings, my program recommends a book off the system of "If you liked (book a) you may like (book b) ". This was done by comparing the cosine similarity of the books and finding the best match.
